Waterloonatic is a tool for organizing one's course plan
as a student at the University of Waterloo. It supplements
the course calendar by providing an automated way to explore
possible schedules while keeping an eye out for prerequisites
and such.

Run <tt>rake doc:app</tt> to generate the full documentation
if you have not already done so.

For development installation, you probably want to run:
<tt>rake gems:install db:create db:migrate tmp:create</tt>.
The installation of gems may require root privileges, depending on
your setup. If this is the case, you may wish to run the
<tt>gems:install</tt> task separately with the necessarily privileges.
Installing the <tt>mongrel</tt> gem will make script/server use
a somewhat better server than WEBrick, though script/server still
isn't suitable for actual deployment.

If you wish to run the tests, make sure that you have the
necessary gems. To do this, run <tt>rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test</tt>.
To run the tests, use <tt>rake spec</tt>. This application uses
RSpec instead of the Test::Unit framework which Rails defaults to.
Again, to install gems you may require privileged access, depending
on your system setup.

If you cannot install gems, it may be possible to install these
as Rails plugins or by freezing them into the vendor directory.
